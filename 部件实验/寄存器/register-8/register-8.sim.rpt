Info: Using vector source file "D:/lym/register-8/register-8.vwf"

Info: Option to preserve fewer signal transitions to reduce memory requirements is enabled
    Info: Simulation has been partitioned into sub-simulations according to the maximum transition count determined by the engine. Transitions from memory will be flushed out to disk at the end of each sub-simulation to reduce memory requirements.
