Info: Command: quartus_sim --read_settings_files=on --write_settings_files=off register-4 -c register-4
Info: Using vector source file "D:/lym/register-4/register-4.vwf"
Info: Simulation end time 50.0 ns did not reach the end of the input vector, which ended at 1.0 us
Info: Option to preserve fewer signal transitions to reduce memory requirements is enabled
    Info: Simulation has been partitioned into sub-simulations according to the maximum transition count determined by the engine. Transitions from memory will be flushed out to disk at the end of each sub-simulation to reduce memory requirements.
